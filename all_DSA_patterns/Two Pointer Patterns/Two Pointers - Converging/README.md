# Two Pointers Pattern: Converging (Sorted Array Target Sum)

## üß≠ PATTERN OVERVIEW

Imagine you and a friend are standing at opposite ends of a long bookshelf, looking for two books whose page counts add up to a specific number. Instead of both of you searching the entire shelf, you each start at one end and move toward each other, comparing the books you find. If the combined page counts are too low, your friend moves forward; if they're too high, you step back. This is the essence of the Converging Two Pointers pattern.

This subpattern is especially powerful when working with sorted arrays or sequences. It lets you efficiently find pairs (or even triplets) of values that meet a certain condition‚Äîlike adding up to a target sum‚Äîwithout checking every possible combination. Think of it as a smart, coordinated search rather than a brute-force hunt.

You'll see this pattern shine in scenarios like:

* Finding two numbers in a sorted list that sum to a target (like splitting a bill between two people).
* Identifying unique triplets in an array that sum to zero (like balancing a budget with three expenses).
* Merging or comparing two sorted lists (like finding common friends in two sorted contact lists).

By moving pointers inward from both ends, you can quickly "zero in" on the answer, making this approach both intuitive and efficient for many real-world and coding interview problems.

## üîç CORE CONCEPTS

At its heart, the Converging Two Pointers technique is about using two markers (pointers) to scan a sorted array from both ends toward the center. Here‚Äôs how it works:

### Why Sorted Arrays?

Sorting brings order. When you know the smallest and largest values are at the ends, you can make smart decisions about which direction to move.
For example, if you want two numbers that add up to 10, and your current pair adds up to 8, you know you need a bigger number‚Äîso move the left pointer right.

### How the Pointers Move:

* **Left Pointer:** Starts at the beginning (smallest value).
* **Right Pointer:** Starts at the end (largest value).
* At each step, you check the sum (or another condition) of the values at both pointers.

  * If the sum is too small, move the left pointer right (to a larger value).
  * If the sum is too big, move the right pointer left (to a smaller value).
  * If the sum matches the target, you've found a solution!

### Efficiency:

Instead of checking every pair (which would be O(n¬≤) time), you only scan the array once‚ÄîO(n) time.
Think of it like reading a book from both ends at once, meeting in the middle, instead of reading every page twice.

### Space Complexity:

Usually O(1) extra space, since you‚Äôre just moving pointers around in the existing array.

### Mathematical Foundation:

The sorted order guarantees that moving pointers inwards will always bring you closer to (or further from) the target in a predictable way.
This predictability is what makes the method so powerful.

### Beyond Pairs:

For problems like "3Sum," you can fix one pointer and use two more to find pairs, extending the idea to triplets.

**Visualize it:**
Imagine a number line with marbles at each position. You and a friend start at opposite ends, rolling marbles toward the center, always checking if the marbles you pick add up to your target. This coordinated movement is what makes the converging two pointers pattern so effective.

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

Let's break down how to approach problems using the Converging Two Pointers pattern:

1. **Recognize the Pattern**

   * Ask yourself: Is the array sorted, or can I sort it? Am I looking for pairs or triplets that meet a numerical condition (like a target sum)?
   * If yes, this pattern is likely a great fit.
2. **Set Up Your Pointers**

   * Place one pointer (left) at the start (index 0).
   * Place the other pointer (right) at the end (last index).
   * For triplet problems, fix one element and use two pointers for the remaining array.
3. **Iterate and Compare**

   ```
   while left < right:
       calculate sum = array[left] + array[right]
       if sum == target:
           record solution
       elif sum < target:
           left += 1  # increase sum
       else:
           right -= 1  # decrease sum
   ```
4. **Handle Duplicates (if needed)**

   * For problems like "3Sum," you may need to skip over duplicate values to avoid duplicate solutions.
5. **Edge Cases**

   * Empty array: Return empty result.
   * No valid pairs: Return empty result.
   * All numbers are the same: Ensure you handle duplicates correctly.
   * Negative numbers: The pattern still works as long as the array is sorted.
6. **Decision Tree Example**

   * Is the array sorted?

     * Yes: Use two pointers.
     * No: Sort first, then apply two pointers.
   * Are you looking for pairs/triplets with a sum/condition?

     * Yes: Two pointers is likely optimal.
     * No: Consider other patterns.
7. **Think Like This**

   * "If my current pair is too small, I need a bigger number‚Äîmove left pointer right."
   * "If my current pair is too big, I need a smaller number‚Äîmove right pointer left."
   * "If I find a match, record it and decide if I need to continue searching for more solutions."
8. **Example Edge Case**

   * Example: `nums = [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]`, `target = 6`

     * Start with left at -4, right at 10. -4 + 10 = 6 (match!).
     * If not a match, adjust pointers as described above.

By following this step-by-step approach, you can confidently tackle a wide range of problems using the converging two pointers pattern.
